      <p>hey. if you're here, its probably because you're an online friend of mine. i'm sorry to inform you, but i will no longer be using any social media accounts. it has both taken a toll on my health and my performance in school. as of 2025-08-28, i have deactivated most of my social media accounts and will continue to do so when i get the chance. i really hate that im doing this but i know thats the god damn addiction talking.</p>
      <p>i'm hoping that i will still be able to make different projects and other cool stuff, and whenever i decide to come back, hopefully never, i might just share them.</p>
      <p>if you <b>really</b> want to contact me, <a href="mailto:whenthewallsbend@proton.me">please email me at whenthewallsbend@proton.me</a></p>
      <p>i will miss you all. goodbye.</p>
